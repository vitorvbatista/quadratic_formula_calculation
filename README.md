Sympy is an important package used to calculate multiple forms of equation quickly.
Speaking about quadratic expression, with 2 lines of code Sympy can solve the problem, bringing dynamism and expand the
code capabilities when working with mathematics.
But in this project I managed to solve simple quadratic equation without Sympy, with purpose to train python and regex
skills.
So far, these quadratic equation models are accepted:
    12x² + 9x - 4 = 0   /
    x² - 5x + 6 = 0   /
    -x² + x + 12 = 0   /
    6x² + x - 1 = 0
